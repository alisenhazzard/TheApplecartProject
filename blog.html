		<a href="#"><h2>Illustrator Foundations</h2></a>
		<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
		<h3 class="date">June 11, 2014</h3>
		<p class="post-content">I've been doing some research into the Adobe programs - <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> has a wonderful collection of videos for learning the foundations of Illustrator and Photoshop from the  bottom-up. Mat Helme, who teaches Illustrator Foundations, does a thorough job of explaining every one of the tools available and how to use them. As a total newbie, this was exactly what I needed.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content">If you're familiar with Photoshop and Illustrator, you already know the whole deal about vector vs. rastor graphics. I found the details of this difference fascinating and important for me to understand as a design student. I started with Photoshop tutorials to get my feet wet, since I had some (read: very limited) experience using it to edit photos. It's very popular among my photographer friends, who seem to use it mainly as editing software rather than a platform for building art from scratch. While this is a perfectly good application of the program, I wanted to know more about using it in other ways.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content">To be honest, I was totally intimidated by Illustrator. (Here's a photo of my first document. Feel free to point and laugh.) Like Photoshop, it was not intuitive for me at all. I really needed someone to say directly, "This is how you do such-and-such, and this is what this tool does."</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content">Now that I've been following along with the Treehouse lessons, there are so many ways to use this program to actually <em>make</em> things. The course has you design a logo using shapes, color, and type (and also explains best practices of typography in graphic design), and now we're moving into drawing to make custom vector artwork. It's been great so far, and I would definitely recommend it if you want to learn Illustrator in depth.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content"><h3>Alisen's Top Tips for Illustrator Beginners:</h3>
			<ol class="post-content">
				<li>Memorize basic <strong>keyboard shortcuts</strong>. Many of them are easy to learn (they become visible when you hover over the tools), and it will speed up your projects.
				<li>If you hand-draw an image that you want to convert to a digital file, you can make the layer a <strong>Template</strong> and use it as a tracing guide.
				<li>Use Shift-E and Shift-B to quickly <strong>switch between the Blog Brush and Eraser</strong> when drawing. (I'm telling you, those keyboard shortcuts...)
				<li><strong>The Swatch Tool</strong> contains preset color pallettes for a variety of projects, including Kid's Stuff, Earthtones, and Skintones. If you need a little inspiration for a color theme, this is a fun place to look.
				<li>Instead of filling an object with a color, you can make a <strong>custom pattern</strong>. This gives me lots of ideas for textiles...

		<a href="#"><h2>The Start of Something</h2></a>
		<h3>New Post | <a href="blog.html" title="See More Blog Posts">Blog</a></h3>
		<h3 class="date">June 6, 2014</h3>
		<p class="post-content">Today is my last day working at a local small business in the East Bay. I'm turning in my keys and leaving my position to make time for my priorities: web design, graphic design, and developing my professional skills. It wasn't an easy decision for me, leaving a money-making job to focus on other things, things which may or may not take many months to show any results. But I'm already glad that I am making this change.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content">I began my professional career as an English major, spending my first few years tyring to find a job (any job!) where I could put my skills and interests to good use. As other BAS majors know, you sometimes have to take what you can get and hope it turns into something more. Even though I did find a few jobs I enjoyed, they were short-term and largely temporary.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content">I don't expect to become success overnight, but I'm so excited to learn again and work for more. It feels good to work on things I'm not yet familiar with - the field is slightly intimidating, but I'm up for the challenge!</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content">Thanks for indulging me. What professional risks are you glad you took?
