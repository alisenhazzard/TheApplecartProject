		<h2>Sticky Footer</h2>
		<h3>Web Design</h3>
		<h3 class="date">June 20, 2014</h3>
		<p class="post-content">When I start making a website, the first problem I run into is creating a sticky footer. All I want is for my footer to stay at the bottom of the page, right from the get-go, so I don’t have to worry about it while I structure the rest of the page. (Is that so much to ask?)</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content">There are a few different ways to get your footer to stay put. This is a bare-bones, no-fuss way to get your very own Sticky Footer.</p>
		<br/>
		<img src="images/footer2.gif" class="blog-image">
		<br/>
		<img src="images/footer3.gif" class="blog-image">
		<ol class="post-content">
			<li>Give html and body a height of 100%.</li>
			<li>Wrap your content in a div with a class of “content-wrapper” (or anything you want) and give the class a min-height: 100%, and margin-bottom: -130px (or however tall you want your footer to be).</li>
			<li>Give your footer a height of 130px (the positive value  of your “content-wrapper” margin-bottom).</li>
			<li>Use the universal selector * to set all margins to 0. This will get rid of the whitespace around your elements and divs, bringing your content to the edges of the window.</li>
		<br/>

		<h2>Painting on Photos</h2>
		<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
		<h3 class="date">June 18, 2014</h3>
		<p class="post-content">I started out editing photos in Photoshop  using the Adjustment features. They're great for turning ho-hum photos into brighter, more vivid images with a greater range of tones. Another way to manually get this effect is to use the Brush tool and add specific colors to your photos in places where they could use more dimension.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content">This is my starting image. It was taken on a beautiful day at Muir Beach in Marin County, CA, but the photo came out very dull. The colors are washed-out and desaturated, and I wanted to give it more life.</p>
		<br/>
		<img src="images/soft-light.png" class="blog-image">
		<p class="post-content">I used a round, soft brush to paint colors over my image. For each color, I added a new layer so I could toggle the visibility off and on to see if I liked the way the image looked after each color. Set each new layer to Soft Light, and adjust the opacity based on how strong you want the color to be. I also grouped these layers together once I was happy with the result. These are the color layers.</p>
		<br/>
		<img src="images/soft-light2.png" class="blog-image">
		<p class="post-content">There are a total of five layers, which add brighter colors to the beach scene. My favorite trick is to use white to highlight - I did this on the hills and rock faces where the sun is shining, and along the beach at the brightest part.</p>
		<br/>
		<img src="images/soft-light1.png" class="blog-image">
		<p class="post-content">The final image is slightly more vibrant, and the hills are still a little dark, but I like that it doesn't look overly manipulated. This is a good technique to use on vacation photos that don't quite capture the mood of a day and just need a slight adjustment.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content">Have you gotten good results with this technique?

		<h2>Pixelated Image in Photoshop</h2>
		<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
		<h3 class="date">June 14, 2014</h3>
		<p class="post-content">Here's a fun and quick effect in Photoshop - it uses only three layers and takes no time at all. I like it because you can adjust the size of the pixels and get different results, depending on how much of the original image you want to remain when you're done.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content">Find an image that has good color contrast. The ones that have worked best for me have different colors, or a range of color, across the entire file. This was my starting image.</p>
		<br/>
		<img src="images/pixel1.jpg" class="blog-image">
		<p class="post-content">Duplicate the layer twice (Command J). On the second layer select all (Command A), and go to Edit > Transform > Skew. Give the layer a horizontal skew of -45. Then go to Filter > Pixelate > Mosaic and select a pixel size. Next, go back to Skew and give the layer a horizontal skew of 45. Here's what you get.</p>
		<br/>
		<img src="images/pixel3.jpg" class="blog-image">
		<p class="post-content">Repeat these steps on the top layer, but start with 45 degrees and end with -45 degrees. It will be hiding the bottom layer, so set the layer style to Screen. You can also adjust the opacity. Here is what the screen layer looks like, with the middle layer visabilty hidden.</p>
		<br/>
		<img src="images/pixel2.jpg" class="blog-image">
		<p class="post-content">Turn on the visabilty for all three layers, and you have your end result. The layers will be slightly off-center from one another, so use the Move Tool (V) to shift one layer until they line up.</p>

	<!-- Illustrator Templates for Tracing -->

		<h2>Illustrator Templates for Tracing</h2>
		<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
		<h3 class="date">June 13, 2014</h3>
		<p class="post-content">One of my new favorite ways to use Illustrator is as a tracing tool. As a kid, I would trace coloring book pages for my friends so we could all color the same pictures together (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lisa+frank&es_sm=91&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=zCqbU9zGCZKqyATJ6YKoDg&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1350&bih=713#q=lisa+frank+coloring+pages&tbm=isch&imgdii=_" target="blank">Lisa Frank</a>, anyone?). Maybe I'm channeling my inner child, but it's a quick way to turn a photo or hand-drawn design into a graphic image. Cool, amirite?</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content">First you open an image in Illustrator and fit it to your canvas size. Use the Selection Tool (V), and while holding Shift, scale the image down to the size you want.</p>
		<br/>
		<img src="images/template1.jpg" class="blog-image" />
		<p class="post-content">In the Layers panel, use the dropdown menu and select Template. This will make your layer transparent. Click to lock the first layer in place. Creat a new layer on top of it, and use one of the drawing tools to trace over the image. (I used the calligraphic brush tool with a 15% angle, 50% roundness, and a size of 1pt.)</p>
		<br/>
		<img src="images/template2.jpg" class="blog-image" />
		<p class="post-content">As you trace, you can toggle the visibility of the first layer to check your sketch and see where you need to add brushstrokes. I took some liberties with the background (no more cars, thankyouverymuch) and spent some time adding detail on the shirt and hair to give it some dimension. You can add more brushstrokes to make areas darker.</p>
		<br/>
		<img src="images/template3.gif" class="blog-image" />
		<p class="post-content">I like using the brush tool, because it smoothes my lines as I go so I don't need to be too precise. You can also trace with the Blob Brush tool, which will turn your paths into shapes, or the Pencil tool, to make it look more like a hand-sketched graphic.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content">Have you done any tracing in Illustrator? Which techniques did you like the most?

		<h2>Illustrator Foundations</h2>
		<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
		<h3 class="date">June 11, 2014</h3>
		<p class="post-content">I've been doing some research into the Adobe programs - <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> has a wonderful collection of videos for learning the foundations of Illustrator and Photoshop from the  bottom-up. Mat Helme, who teaches Illustrator Foundations, does a thorough job of explaining every one of the tools available and how to use them. As a total newbie, this was exactly what I needed.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content">If you're familiar with Photoshop and Illustrator, you already know the whole deal about vector vs. rastor graphics. This difference is totally fascinating to me and important to understand as a design student. I started with Photoshop tutorials to get my feet wet, since I had some (read: very limited) experience using it to edit photos. It's popular among my photographer friends, who seem to use it mainly as editing software rather than a platform for building art from scratch. While this is a perfectly good application of the program, I wanted to know more about using it in other ways.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content">To be honest, I was totally intimidated by Illustrator. Like Photoshop, it was not intuitive for me at all. I really needed someone to say directly, "This is how you do such-and-such, and this is what this tool does."</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content">Now that I've been following along with the Treehouse lessons, there are so many ways to use this program to actually <em>make</em> things. The course has you design a logo using shapes, color, and type (and also explains best practices of typography in graphic design), and now we're moving into drawing to make custom vector artwork. It's been great so far, and I would definitely recommend it if you want to learn Illustrator in depth.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content"><h3>Alisen's Top Tips for Illustrator Beginners:</h3>
			<ol class="post-content">
				<li>Memorize basic <strong>keyboard shortcuts</strong>. Many of them are easy to learn (they become visible when you hover over the tools), and it will speed up your projects.
				<li>If you hand-draw an image that you want to convert to a digital file, you can make the layer a <strong>Template</strong> and use it as a <a href="#ill-template">tracing guide</a>.
				<li>Use Shift-E and Shift-B to quickly <strong>switch between the Blog Brush and Eraser</strong> when drawing. (I'm telling you, those keyboard shortcuts...)
				<li>The <strong>Swatch Tool</strong> contains preset color palettes for a variety of projects, including Kid's Stuff, Earth-tones, and Skin-tones. If you need a little inspiration for a color theme, this is a fun place to look.
				<li>Instead of filling an object with a color, you can make your own <strong> custom pattern</strong>, adjusting the size and layout in lots of fun ways.

	<!-- The Start of Something -->
	<div class="new-post" id="the-start">
		<h2>The Start of Something</h2>
		<h3 class="date">June 7, 2014</h3>
		<p class="post-content">Yesterday was my last day working at a local small business in the East Bay. I turned in my keys and left my position to make time for my priorities: web design, graphic design, and developing my professional skills. It wasn't an easy decision for me, leaving a money-making job to focus on other things, things which may or may not take many months to show any results. But I'm already glad that I'm making this change.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content">I began my professional career as an English major, spending my first few years trying to find a job (any job!) where I could put my skills and interests to good use. As other BAS majors know, you sometimes have to take what you can get and hope it turns into something more. Even though I did find a few jobs I enjoyed, in the back of my mind I always felt they were only temporary.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content">I don't expect to become success overnight, but I'm so excited to learn and work for more. It feels good to try new things that I'm not yet familiar with - the field is slightly intimidating, and I often feel like there is an endless amount of learning to do. But I'm up for the challenge! I recently read a great article on the <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/zach-leatherman/2014-June-7" target="blank">Imposter Syndrome</a>, which helps me get going on days when I'm less than excited.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="post-content">Thanks for indulging me. What professional risks are you glad you took?
